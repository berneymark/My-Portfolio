# Mark Berney's Portfolio
I am working on this portfolio, both to learn and show off what I am learning, as well as to point to other projects in the future. I hope to update this site in the future when I have more knowledge to make it even better.

# Test On Local Machine
To test my site and learn how it works, you must have `npm` installed. Once that is done run the command `npm install` to download any libraries or other such things that I have used.

To run the site and view it in your browser, type the command `npm start` where it should open up in your browser. If it doesn't type in the URL `localhost:3000` into your browser.
